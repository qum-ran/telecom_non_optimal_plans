Telecom: Finding Clients with Non-Optimal Plans
<a href = 'https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/qum-ran/telecom_non_optimal_plans/blob/main/Telecom_overpaying_clients.ipynb'>Telecom Project</a>

Our team's Client is CallMeMaybe:
The virtual telephony service CallMeMaybe is developing some new functions that will give supervisors information on the clients with non-optimal plans.

Our task is to find clients who:

a) Overpay for their current plans
b) Need bigger plans, since they'll be more advantageous
